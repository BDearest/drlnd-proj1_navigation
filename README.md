    "This project trains an agent to collect yellow bananas and avoid blue bananas within the Unity Banana environment. The state has a length of 37 and contains information regarding the speed and the items in the path of the agent. The agent has four actions: move forward, move backward, move left and move right. The environment is considered solved when the average score is at least 13 over 100 consecutive episodes.\n",
